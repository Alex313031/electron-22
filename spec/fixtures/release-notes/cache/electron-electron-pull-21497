Briefly, the issue is that canceling a `nativeWindowOpen`-ed window in the `new-window` event causes a hang because the WebContents is already initializing. This change adds a hook earlier, so we can cancel before it starts loading.\r\n\r\n#21236 is the \"right way\", this change is because we need the workaround sooner than time allows. We'd prefer not to rush the addition of a new API!\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
