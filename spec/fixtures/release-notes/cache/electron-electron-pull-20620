Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\nStarting with the 8-x series we are going to switch to having an 8-x-y branch from which we can publish 8-0-x releases as well as (if necessary) 8-x-y releases.  This means that if we want to release a minor version we will no longer have to create a new branch for that minor.  \r\n\r\nThis PR changes our release scripts to allow for minor bumps.  There will need to be corresponding changes made to sudowoodo and trop to support this change.\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
