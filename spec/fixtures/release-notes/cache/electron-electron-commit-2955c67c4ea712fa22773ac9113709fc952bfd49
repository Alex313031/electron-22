This bug has been present for a long time, but after playing around a bit I've determined that it's possible to catch faulty `deviceName`s by pulling out some of the printer validation code from Chromium. This PR adds that check for Windows and macOS as well as tests for the same.\r\n\r\nTested with:\r\n```js\r\nwin.webContents.on('did-finish-load', () => {\r\n   win.webContents.print({deviceName: 'bad-printer-name'}, (success, reason) => {\r\n      console.log(`printing ${success ? 'did' : 'did not'} succeed: ${reason}`)\r\n   })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @ckerr @zcbenz \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
