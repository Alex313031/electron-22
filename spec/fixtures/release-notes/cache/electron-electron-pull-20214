This is be faster, more featureful, and less surprising than the existing logic, since it more-or-less matches the logic that backs `postMessage`.\r\n\r\nThis brings about a 2x performance boost for large buffers and complex objects. Latency for small messages is not significantly affected.\r\n\r\nUser-observable differences from the existing IPC API:\r\n- It's about 2x faster.\r\n- `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `undefined` are transferred as such, rather than being converted to `null`.\r\n- Cyclic objects can be transmitted.\r\n- `Set` and `Map`, `Error`, `RegExp`, `Date` and `BigInt` can be transmitted.\r\n- `Buffer` will be converted to `Uint8Array`.\r\n- Typed arrays (`Float32Array` and friends) will be transmitted as they are, instead of being converted to `Buffer`.\r\n- Sparse arrays will be transferred as sparse arrays, instead of being converted to dense arrays with `null`s.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE**: Objects that aren't serializable with V8's Structured Clone algorithm, such as functions, DOM objects, special Node/Electron objects like `process.env` or `WebContents`, or any objects containing such items will be serialized with the old `base::Value`-based algorithm. However, this behavior is deprecated and will throw an exception beginning with Electron 9.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
