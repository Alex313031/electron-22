# Examples Overview

In this section, we have collected a set of guides for common features
that you may want to implement in your Electron application. Each guide
contains a practical example in a minimal, self-contained example app.
The easiest way to run these examples is by downloading [Electron Fiddle][fiddle].

Once Fiddle is installed, you can press on the "Open in Fiddle" button that you
will find below code samples like the following one:

```fiddle docs/fiddles/quick-start
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const replaceText = (selector, text) => {
    const element = document.getElementById(selector)
    if (element) element.innerText = text
  }

  for (const type of ['chrome', 'node', 'electron']) {
    replaceText(`${type}-version`, process.versions[type])
  }
})
```

If there is still something that you do not know how to do, please take a look at the [API][app]
as there is a chance it might be documented just there (and also open an issue requesting the
guide!).
