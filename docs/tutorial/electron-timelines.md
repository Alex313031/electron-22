# Electron Releases

Electron frequently releases major versions alongside every other Chromium release.
This document focuses on the release cadence and version support policy.

**Notes:**

* The `-alpha.1`, `-beta.1`, and `stable` dates are our solid release dates.
* We strive for weekly alpha/beta releases, but we often release more than scheduled.
* All dates are our goals but there may be reasons for adjusting the stable deadline, such as security bugs.

**Historical changes:**

* Since Electron 5, Electron has been publicizing its release dates ([see blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-5-0-timeline)).
* Since Electron 6, Electron major versions have been targeting every other Chromium major version. Each Electron stable should happen on the same day as Chrome stable ([see blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/12-week-cadence)).
* Since Electron 16, Electron has been releasing major versions on an 8-week cadence in accordance to Chrome's change to a 4-week release cadence ([see blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/8-week-cadence)).

## Version support policy

:::info

Beginning in September 2021 (Electron 15), the Electron team
will temporarily support the latest **four** stable major versions. This
extended support is intended to help Electron developers transition to
the [new 8-week release cadence](https://electronjs.org/blog/8-week-cadence),
and will continue until the release of Electron 19. At that time,
the Electron team will drop support back to the latest three stable major versions.

:::

The latest three *stable* major versions are supported by the Electron team.
For example, if the latest release is 6.1.x, then the 5.0.x as well
as the 4.2.x series are supported. We only support the latest minor release
for each stable release series. This means that in the case of a security fix,
6.1.x will receive the fix, but we will not release a new version of 6.0.x.

The latest stable release unilaterally receives all fixes from `main`,
and the version prior to that receives the vast majority of those fixes
as time and bandwidth warrants. The oldest supported release line will receive
only security fixes directly.

### Breaking API changes

When an API is changed or removed in a way that breaks existing functionality, the
previous functionality will be supported for a minimum of two major versions when
possible before being removed. For example, if a function takes three arguments,
and that number is reduced to two in major version 10, the three-argument version would
continue to work until, at minimum, major version 12. Past the minimum two-version
threshold, we will attempt to support backwards compatibility beyond two versions
until the maintainers feel the maintenance burden is too high to continue doing so.

### End-of-life

When a release branch reaches the end of its support cycle, the series
will be deprecated in NPM and a final end-of-support release will be
made. This release will add a warning to inform that an unsupported
version of Electron is in use.

These steps are to help app developers learn when a branch they're
using becomes unsupported, but without being excessively intrusive
to end users.

If an application has exceptional circumstances and needs to stay
on an unsupported series of Electron, developers can silence the
end-of-support warning by omitting the final release from the app's
`package.json` `devDependencies`. For example, since the 1-6-x series
ended with an end-of-support 1.6.18 release, developers could choose
to stay in the 1-6-x series without warnings with `devDependency` of
`"electron": 1.6.0 - 1.6.17`.
