        The <code>BrowserWindow</code> module in Electron allows you to create a
        new browser window or manage an existing one.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Each browser window is a separate process, known as the renderer
        process. This process, like the main process that controls the life
        cycle of the app, has full access to the Node.js APIs.

            In this demo, we create a new window and listen for
            <code>blur</code> event on it. Click the demo button to create a new
            modal window, and switch focus back to the parent window by clicking
            on it. You can click the <i>Focus on Demo</i> button to switch focus
            to the modal window again.
