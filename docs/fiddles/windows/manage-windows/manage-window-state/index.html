        The <code>BrowserWindow</code> module in Electron allows you to create a
        new browser window or manage an existing one.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Each browser window is a separate process, known as the renderer
        process. This process, like the main process that controls the life
        cycle of the app, has full access to the Node.js APIs.

            In this demo we create a new window and listen for
            <code>move</code> and <code>resize</code> events on it. Click the
            demo button, change the new window and see the dimensions and
            position update here, above.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of methods for controlling the state of the window
            such as the size, location, and focus status as well as events to
            listen to for window changes. Visit the
            <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">
              documentation (opens in new window)
            </a>
            for the full list.
